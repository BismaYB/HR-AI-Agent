## Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Ilmora AI Developer Internship Task.
The main objective is to build a simple HR AI Agent that can:

1. Parse resumes (PDF/DOCX)

2. Extract useful candidate information (email, skills, text)

3. Compare resumes against a Job Description (JD)

4. Rank candidates based on AI similarity scoring

  ## Resume Screening AI Backend

Built a simple FastAPI backend where HR can:

Upload a Job Description (JD)

Upload multiple resumes (PDF/DOCX)

Extract key details from resumes (text, email, skills)

Use a sentence-transformer model to compare resumes with JD

Rank candidates based on AI similarity score

Output: A ranked list of candidates with score, skills, and email
